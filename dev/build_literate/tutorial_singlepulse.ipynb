    "## Transversal Magnetization of the Semi-Solid Spin Pool\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we only ever calculated and plotted the longitudinal magnetization of the semi-solid spin pool. This is foremost a result of way we formulate and solve the generalized Bloch equations (cf. Eq. (9) in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.29071)). But this implementation is also reflective of the standard use-case in magnetization transfer imaging, where we are foremost interested in the longitudinal magnetization of the semi-solid spin pool and its effect on the free spin pool. If required, however, it is easily possible to calculate the transversal magnetization with Eqs. (4-5) from the paper:"
